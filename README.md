your bot will now be created and you will now see your bots infomation, feel free to add a bot image or description if you like

![Lewis broke it](https://github.com/OTAL2020/messaging-api/blob/main/Documentation/Images/discordRedirectsimage.png)  
next we will shall add a redirect url so we can access the Oauth2 features, you may add your own url, for this example i shall use google.com

![Lewis broke it](https://github.com/OTAL2020/messaging-api/blob/main/Documentation/Images/discordOauth2Example.png)

once a url has been added, you should see your url show up below inside the dropdown bowx below, next we shall move on to the scopes tab
check the bot box and below a new bot tab shall open, for this example we shall use the Adminstrator box for all features allowed
now if we go back to the bottom of the scopes tab, a link will have been autogenerated, 
we shall be using this link and sending it to the guild owners for them to be added your bot to there discord guild
once another guild onwer clicks this links and authorizes your bot onto their server, your bot will be added to their guild and your done

if you wish to add this example bot we made today, i will leave the link for you to add it in [DiscordAPIDocumentationBot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=896600592691109938&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&scope=bot)
